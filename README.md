# todo-list
In this project, I will be making a fully interactive single-page todo-list/task-list app. The app will allow users to create custom task lists, add notes to task objects, and dynamically strike/remove items from individual lists. I will be using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, and I will also be practicing my WebPack skills.
